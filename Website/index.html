<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The BNB Foundation was established in May 2014 and has provided over $5000 in scholarships to 17 outstanding students. In high school, our scholars have demonstrated academic excellence, positive leadership and dedication to community service. It is our hope that they will continue to strive for excellence throughout college and well into their careers. We expect that as our scholars pursue their passions and serve their communities, they will create an enduring legacy. 
However, the BNB Foundation is much more than a program that awards outstanding students financial assistance. We pride ourselves in knowing that our mentoring programs connect our scholars with like-minded individuals and professionals. The BNB Foundation seeks to create a lifetime connection that starts with investing in future leaders through consistent, reliable sources of support and inspiration. </p>

<p>
Meet Briana Natalie Brown, CEO and Founder of the BNB Foundation! She is an alumnus of Ramapo High School located in Rockland County, NY and graduated at 16 years old with an advanced regent&#39;s diploma. Her ambition led her to Stony Brook University, where she completed a Dual Bachelor&#39;s Degree in Applied Math and Statistics &amp; Technological Systems Management, with a specialization in Mechanical Engineering in December 2013. For Briana, learning is a lifelong pursuit, but she felt the need to do more than stand on the pillars of her own success. Briana&#39;s keen interest in advocating for the underrepresented was nurtured by her involvement in the National Association for Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and in Alpha Omega Epsilon Sorority, Inc. Exposure to such organizations impacted her perspective on professional readiness, community service and mentorship. Having benefitted from the guidance of mentors and as the recipient of numerous scholarships, she hopes that by offering this opportunity to other students, they will have the tools to pursue their passions as well.

In light of her demanding career as a Manufacturing Operations Supervisor at Sikorsky Aircraft a helicopter manufacturer, Briana is immersed in the business of generosity. Some of her frequent practices include visiting educational institutions, after school programs, and speaking on the importance of higher education and professional development. The legacy she wants to leave behind is cloaked in the foundation's vision, which is to inspire young men and women to pursue their passions and to share the gift of generosity.

Matthew Brown is a search analyst at ConvergeDirect located in New York City. His interest in technology and media was ignited at Ramapo High School through the local NAACP Spring Valley Chapter&#39;s Ogilvy &amp; Mather internship program. During this program, he conducted research and presented projects on current media advertising techniques; at the conclusion of his summer, he was awarded the Marlon Layne Award for Advertising Excellence. As a result, Matthew pursued a career focused in Marketing and Information Technology at Babson College. At Babson, Matthew realized his passion for youth development and mentorship. He participated in the Barton Road Afterschool Program, which is a comprehensive afterschool tutoring and enrichment program, targeted towards underserved elementary and middle school students.
